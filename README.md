# lab_parallel

This repository was created so I can save the small projects created when having classes on Parallel and Distributed Systems at IME-USP.
The following names are the projects created until now:

- prod_cons
- helloworld


## Advanced topics in C language

As I am not an expert in C programming language, some exercises I've created in this repository was hard for me at first
and led me to do some research on some advanced topics in C programming language. As by the exercises, the focus wasn't
targeted on these advanced topics, so I just researched what was needed to do the exercises.

Someday (if needed) I will come back to these advanced topics to get a deeper understand on each subject.
The following list presents all of these topics that I want to better understand someday:

- [Strinct Aliasing](https://cellperformance.beyond3d.com/articles/2006/06/understanding-strict-aliasing.html)
- [Demistifying restrict keyword](https://cellperformance.beyond3d.com/articles/2006/05/demystifying-the-restrict-keyword.html)
- [Understanding C by learning assembly](https://www.recurse.com/blog/7-understanding-c-by-learning-assembly)
